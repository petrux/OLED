OLED
====

OLED is an OntoUML lightweight editor.

DISCLAIMER
----------

This repository is a *hand-made* clone of the official OLED repository and its only purpose is to improve the tool performing the **conversion from OntoUML to SBVR** As a consequence, the only modified project that would be `br.ufes.inf.nemo.ontouml2sbvr`. For the actual OLED code, please refer to the original project repository on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/ontouml-lightweight-editor/).

**PLEASE NOTE THAT** I personally disagree with some design choices and typographical conventions, anyway I'll stay stick to them as my contributio to the project is intended to be strictly limited to what exposed above.
