OLED
====

This repository is a clone of the official OLED repository. Its only purpose is to improve the tool performing the **conversion from OntoUML to SBVR**, so the only modified project that would be `br.ufes.inf.nemo.ontouml2sbvr`. For the actual OLED code, please refer to the original project repository on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/ontouml-lightweight-editor/).
